								<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
								<p>I am Sancchit and I recently completed my journey at <strong>Stevens Institute of Technology</strong> in pursuit of a Masters of Engineering degree in <strong>Engineering Management</strong> with concentration in <strong>Data Analytics</strong>.I am currently working as a Data Analyst on contract basis at <b>Nasdaq Inc</b> through my employer Marlabs Inc LLC. I was previously a Data Analyst Intern at a Non-Profit called called <b>'Bright Mind Enrichment and Schooling'</b>. </p>
								<p>I graduated in May 2015 with a Bachelors degree in <b>Computer Science</b> from <b>University of Mumbai</b>.I am an ambitious person who has a strong work ethic and personality who aspires to be successful in the field of Analytics. I strive to be versatile which helps me understand lot of different domains enabling to expand my knowledge about various industries. Bringing a strong background of the skills required so far in my career, academics, not only from my years in college, but as well as in high school and other experinces, I consider myself a strong candidate in the workplace.</p>
								<p>I am very hardworking, trustworthy and dedicated while having developed a good business acumen with problem solving skills, and I feel that these qualities are required for someone who is choosing to pursue a career in this industry. I know that with all my previous experience I have had throughout my education and work, I will be able to excel in the field of analytics</p>
								<h2><b>Work Experience</b> </h2>
								<p> At Present,I am working as a <b>Data Analyst at</b> <b>Nasdaq Inc</b>,the technolgies used are SQL for data wrangling operations, Python (libraries: numpy, sci-kit learn, pandas) for visualizations while familiarizing myself with <b>Microsoft Azure</b> cloud technology. The project I am working on is a Stock Prediction analysis project, where the data consists of record of over 11 years. The analysis is to forecast the stock rise and fall over the next 6 months from the last date of data entry record. </p>
								<p>Previously, while working at <b>Bright Mind Enrichment and Schooling</b> which is a non-profit organization for Homeless people as a <b>Data Analyst Intern</b>, I used SQL to pull out the data from Excel sheet and carry out Data Wrangling operations, and integrated later with Tableau to build dashboard. The analysis helped to create the user stories to build strategy to resettle homeless people based on the priority of situation. The organization was able to resettle around 3000 homeless people collectively in the states of Maryland and Florida. </p>
								<p> My first experience was with <b>Maha Technoplast</b>, where initially I started off as a part of web development team. The management later realizing my strengths with problem solving skills introduced me to analytics team as a <b>Business Analyst</b>. While working as a Business Analyst for over 3.5 years, I had a great exposure to optimize the Business process and build new business process by creating business process flows on <b>Microsoft Visio</b>. Additional responsibilities included that of <b>Project Manager</b>, where I used to manage the project in the agile environment. The highlight of my time here was that I was a part of team which managed to increase sales by over 40% for the period of 2 years from 2017-19. </p>
